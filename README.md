# Wanderer Website Clone

This project is a clone of the Wanderer website, implemented using SvelteKit and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to replicate the functionality and design of the original Wanderer website while leveraging the power and flexibility of the SvelteKit framework.

## Introduction

The Wanderer website is a popular platform for exploring travel destinations, sharing travel experiences, and connecting with other travelers. With its intuitive user interface and rich features, it has become a go-to destination for travel enthusiasts worldwide.

This project aims to recreate the core features of the Wanderer website, including:

- User authentication and authorization
- Browsing and searching for travel destinations
- Viewing detailed information and reviews for destinations
- Creating and sharing travel experiences
- Interacting with other users through comments and likes

## Technologies Used

- **SvelteKit**: SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications with Svelte. It provides a powerful yet simple way to create dynamic, reactive user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is the primary programming language used in this project for implementing logic, handling events, and interacting with the DOM.
- **HTML/CSS**: HTML and CSS are used for structuring the content and styling the user interface, respectively.
- **Node.js**: Node.js is used as the backend server for handling requests, managing data, and communicating with external services.
- **REST API**: The project may utilize RESTful APIs for fetching data from external sources, such as travel destination information, user profiles, and authentication services.
